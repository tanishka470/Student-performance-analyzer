# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance and attendance using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It calculates total and average marks, determines subject-wise averages, and visualizes the relationship between attendance and performance through graphs.

## Features
- Calculates total and average marks for each student.
- Computes subject-wise averages using NumPy.
- Analyzes the correlation between attendance and average performance.
- Visualizes results using bar, line, and pie charts with Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset (`student_scores.csv`) contains:
- **Name** – Student name  
- **Math, Science, English** – Marks obtained  
- **Attendance** – Attendance percentage  

## How to Run
